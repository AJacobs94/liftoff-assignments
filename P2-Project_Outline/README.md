## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My Idea is R-MAV, a video game recommendation site. Consumers can create an account, and search for 
video games similar to the ones they enjoy. After searching for items related to titles of interest,
they will be able to make a personalized list of items they found and would like to refer to at a 
later time. They will also be able to purchase these items through links attached to the title.

I have thought of this countless times while trying to look for video games similar to ones I like, and it 
can be a tedious task. We help game lovers find games related to titles they love without the hassle of 
researching it themselves. It is easy to use, and the users will always need a good new recommendation.


### Features
-User Login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in.

-Search:Users will be able to search for items similar to what their interests are.

-List: Users will be able to view a recommendation list based on their search.
